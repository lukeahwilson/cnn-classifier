# PROGRAMMER: Luke Wilson
# DATE CREATED: 2021-09-27
# REVISED DATE: 2021-01-01
# PURPOSE:
#   - Leverage pretrained vision models for training and application on classifying flowers by name
# REQUIREMENTS:
#   - Pretained model is downloaded and can be trained for this flower application by user
#   - The number of attached fully connected layers is customizable by the user
#   - The later portion of the network is unfrozen for a period of time during training for tuning
#   - User can load a model and continue training or move directly to inference
#   - Saved trained model information is stored in a specific folder with a useful naming convention
#   - There are time-limited prompts that allow the user to direct processes as needed
#   - Training performance can be tested before moving onward to inference if desired
#   - Predictions are made using paralleled batches and are saved in a results dictionary
# HOW TO USE:
#   - If no model has been trained and saved, start by training a model
#   - Store data in folders at this location: os.path.expanduser('~') + '/Programming Data/'
#   - For training, 'train' and 'valid' folders with data are required in the data_dir
#   - For overfit testing, an 'overfit' folder with data is required in the data_dir
#   - For performance testing, a 'test' folder with data is required in the data_dir
#   - For inference, put data of interest in a 'predict' folder in the data_dir
#   - For saving and loading models, create a 'models' folder in the data_dir
