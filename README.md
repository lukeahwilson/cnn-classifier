## Credits
This repository was built on the knowledge acquired from the high-quality and indepth lectures, assignments, and projects that I completed in attendance of Udacity's paid nanodegree program 'AI Programming with Python'. This repository also used design ideas presented from Stanford's online lecture series CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition.

## Dependencies
Please see the `requirements.txt` file or the environment `env-convolutional-classifier.yaml` file for minimal dependencies required to run the repository code.

### Install
To install these dependencies with pip, you can issue `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
To install these dependencies with conda, use `conda env create --file env-convolutional-classifier.yaml`
